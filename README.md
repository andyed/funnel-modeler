# funnel-modeler
AI generated web app to model conversion funnels and explore what if scenarios.

This app was generated through a dialogue with  Anthropic Sonnet 3.5 using Poe (http://poe.com) Previews.

A previous version of this app was built in ~2003 and used for a research article on instrumentation for highly interactive web apps, as those were just becoming a thing (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/edmondsjwe2007.pdf)
